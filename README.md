In order to run Durak, you must clone the repo to you computer. After that, enter the repo and run:

```python
python3 card_game.py
```



If you want to check out the full rules for Durak, you can click [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durak). In order to play a card, click and drag a card from your hand into the playing field where you want it to go (if you are attacking, you only need to drag it into the field). If you want to end your attack, click on the blue button on the left. If you are unable to beat cards set against you, you may also click the blue button on the left to pick them up. The goal of the game is to get rid of all of your cards; good luck!
